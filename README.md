# README_Generator

## Description
This project was built with the direction of challenge in the UT Full Stack Coding Bootcamp. Using starter code I built a 
command line application that accepts user input and takes that input to generate a professional README file. Using NodeJS and one of its children packages Inquirer, I wrote code in JS to ultimately output a file that passes as a professional README.md. 
As a user, it is important to understand the basic formatting of markdown and what is important in a README file. Information collected from the user includes: Title, Description, Installation, Usage Information, Contribution Guidelines, Test Instructions and a choice for a license badge.
